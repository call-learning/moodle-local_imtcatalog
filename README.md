Resource Library Local plugin
=============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/call-learning/moodle-local_resourcelibrary.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/call-learning/moodle-local_resourcelibrary)

This plugin adds new customs fields (using the new customfield API in Moodle 3.7) to Courses and Activities so they can be searched and classified.
The customfields are then used to filter courses and activities on a catalog page.

The plugin has been developed for Institut Mines Telecom for its ([Pedagothèque Numérique](https://www.imt.fr/formation/academie-transformations-educatives/ressources-pedagogiques/pedagotheque-numerique/)),
a course, teaching and learning activities catalog.

Installation
============

Add plugin code into the moodle local folder and run an update/upgrade.  You should now see a new plugin and new menus under the Administration > Courses menu.

Usage
=====

The plugin will add a menu under Administration > Courses menu, so a new type of custom fields for activities can be added:
* custom fields for activities

Those custom fields will then be taken into account in the resource library page and each field will have its related search form entry.

The plugin will also add a new navigation menu called "Resources Library" that will list
all available courses. If you need to make this page accessible through non logged in users, make sure
you set the "autologin" to on in the Administration > Site administration > Users > Permissions > User policies 
(See [Auto Login Guest](https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Guest_access)). If not a login prompt will appear to see the page.

If you need to hide courses regardless of the course visibility status, you can do so by adding the course ids 
in the 'hiddencoursesid' settings. The course will not appear in the resource library.

This is a temporary solution while looking at more generic solution such as hiding a course per category, tag or other.
