  Scenario: As an admin if I set a value for a course custom field, then I should be able to retrieve it after.
    Given I am on site homepage
    And I log in as "admin"
    Given I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I navigate to "Edit settings" in current page administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    Then I wait until the page is ready
    Then I should see "Resource Library: Generic fields"
    Then I should see "Test Field"
    And the field "Test Field" matches value "ABCDEF"
    Then I set the field "Test Field" to "ACDBE"
    And I click on "Save" "button"
    Given I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I navigate to "Edit settings" in current page administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And the field "Test Field" matches value "ACDBE"
